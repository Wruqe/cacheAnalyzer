## This is my stride walker project


### Goals: Figuring out how the cachlines work, how to stay within the cache line, and see different cache lines being used. 


### Results/learnings: 
#### each cache line has a range of numbers it can process at a time, so for exmaple if we are stepping by 1 number at a time,
that is 4 bytes being loaded into memory each loop this passes the L1 cache line and stays in there. The L1 cache can handle up to 16 numbers per
iteration which is about 64 bytes which checks out. Other cache lines'(L2: <= 512 bytes, L3: <= 8192 bytes)'.
